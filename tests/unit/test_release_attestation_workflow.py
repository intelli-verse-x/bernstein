"""Smoke test: the release-attestation workflow steps are present and well-formed.

Closes the FINOS AIGF CTRL-MODEL-SUPPLY-CHAIN release-artefact gap by
asserting that the publish + auto-release workflows actually call
``actions/attest-build-provenance`` against ``dist/*`` with the right
permissions. Without this guard the gap could silently re-open during
a workflow refactor.

The test parses the YAML and walks the job tree; it does not execute
the workflows. The end-to-end ``gh attestation verify`` against the
public attestations endpoint is the responsibility of the dedicated
release-attestation smoke job (see ``release-attestation`` workflow).
