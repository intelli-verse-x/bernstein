# Testing & CI Hardening Reference

This page documents the test tooling we run on every PR and overnight,
what bug class each tool catches, and how to reproduce a CI failure
locally without waiting for the cloud runner.

## Tool ↔ bug-class matrix

| Tool                        | Bug class                                                         | When                |

| **mutmut full**             | Test-effectiveness gaps across the whole repo                     | nightly (advisory)  |
| **Semgrep** (custom rules)  | eval/exec/pickle in production, env-leak in `_spawn_*`            | PR (ERROR fails)    |
| **Bandit**                  | Generic Python security smells (shell=True, weak hash, tarfile)   | PR (HIGH only)      |

| **Vulture**                 | Dead code (unused functions/classes/vars at confidence ≥80)       | PR                  |
| **diff-cover**              | <80% coverage on lines this PR changed                            | PR (advisory)       |
| **import-linter**           | Architecture-contract violations (cross-package imports)          | PR                  |

# Semgrep (project rules; ERROR severity is the PR gate).
# Install once via `uv tool install semgrep` — semgrep's transitive
# pins (click<8.2, opentelemetry-sdk<1.26) conflict with our project
# floors, so it lives in its own venv outside `uv sync`.
uv tool install semgrep
uv tool run semgrep --config .semgrep.yml --severity ERROR --error src/

# Bandit (production HIGH-only with baseline)
uv run bandit -r src/ -ll --severity-level high -b .bandit-baseline.json

## When a tool fires on you

### Semgrep ERROR
The rule is intentionally tight. If you genuinely need the pattern,
add the inline `# nosemgrep: <rule-id>  -- <one-line justification>`
comment. PRs that disable a rule without justification get bounced.

### Bandit HIGH
Only HIGH fails the PR; the 11 pre-existing HIGH findings on `main`
are captured in `.bandit-baseline.json`. New HIGH findings need either
a fix or an explicit baseline update with rationale in the PR
description.

### Hypothesis falsifying example
The error output includes a `git apply .hypothesis/patches/...` line.
Apply that patch to add the failing example as a deterministic
regression case, fix the bug, and the patch becomes a permanent unit
test.

### Schemathesis 5xx leak
A real bug — an endpoint should never propagate an unhandled
exception. The reproducer is printed at the bottom of the failure (a
`curl` invocation against the mounted ASGI app).

### Snapshot diff
If the diff is intentional (you changed an audit field on purpose),
re-run with `--snapshot-update` and commit the updated `.ambr`. If
not, you've caused unintended wire-format drift.

### mutmut survivor
The mutation operator changed `==` to `!=` (etc.) and no test
caught it. Either add a test that distinguishes the two operators
or, if the mutation is genuinely undetectable (e.g. an off-by-one
in a comment-only path), document why in `mutmut_config.py`.

### mutmut fixed-paths gate
`mutation-fixed.yml` runs `scripts/mutmut_critical.py` against a
fixed list of high-risk modules (atomic claim, HMAC audit chain,
audit integrity verifier, lineage v1 trio, seed parser) and gates
on a per-module kill rate. The module list, per-module thresholds,
and wall-clock budgets live in `scripts/mutmut_critical.py:MODULES`.

The gate is **advisory** while thresholds calibrate (the matrix job
sets `continue-on-error: true`). The PR comment posted by the
workflow summarises each module's score and survivors; until the
gate is flipped to enforcing, treat a red row as a follow-up TODO,
not a merge blocker.

Reproduce locally:

```bash
# All modules (slow — budgets sum to about an hour).
uv run python scripts/mutmut_critical.py

# One module:
uv run python scripts/mutmut_critical.py --only claim_next
uv run python scripts/mutmut_critical.py --list   # show keys
```

Adding a module to the gate: extend `MODULES` in
`scripts/mutmut_critical.py`, mirror the matrix in
`.github/workflows/mutation-fixed.yml`, and add the source/test
paths to the `paths:` filter on the same workflow.

## CI cost budget

PR-time CI must stay under 2× the pre-2026 baseline. Heavy work
(full mutmut, deep Hypothesis, full Schemathesis, full CrossHair)
runs only in `nightly-deep-tests.yml` (cron `0 3 * * *`) and is
explicitly `continue-on-error` so an overnight regression doesn't
block tomorrow's PRs.

The added PR-time jobs target ≤8 min wall-clock each and run in
parallel after the lint job clears (so a typo PR fails fast in <2
min without burning compute on the heavy stack).
