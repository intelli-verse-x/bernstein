"""Bridge between :class:`HookRegistry` and the project-wide pluggy manager.

The bridge defines a set of hookspecs matching the lifecycle events so
that regular plugins can subscribe via ``@hookimpl``, then wires the
pluggy ``PluginManager`` into a :class:`HookRegistry` instance so that
firing an event dispatches to both script/callable hooks and pluggy
implementations.
