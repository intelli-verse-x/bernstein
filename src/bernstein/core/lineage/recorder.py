"""``LineageRecorder`` — orchestrates a single artefact write into the log.

The recorder is the small piece of glue between the storage layer
(``LineageStore``) and the policy that decides what an entry actually
*means*. It:

1. Computes ``content_hash = sha256(new_content)``.
2. Looks up the current tip(s) for the artefact via the store.
3. Builds a ``LineageEntry`` with the appropriate ``parent_hashes``:
     * empty list → genesis (first write).
     * single parent → linear successor.
     * The caller is responsible for explicit merges; we never invent
       multi-parent entries on the agent's behalf.
4. Computes the HMAC envelope with the operator key over the entry's
   canonical bytes minus the ``operator_hmac`` field itself.
5. Signs ``entry_hash`` (RFC 7515 + RFC 8037 detached JWS, EdDSA) with
   the agent's Ed25519 private key.
6. Hands everything to the store, which fsyncs + flocks the log.
7. Emits an OpenTelemetry span (no-op when telemetry is not initialised).

The recorder rejects path traversal and absolute paths so an attacker
controlling the call site cannot smuggle ``../`` outside the repo or
anchor an artefact at ``/etc/passwd`` — both surface as ``ValueError``
before any HMAC or signature is computed.
